= Notes =

[Jetpack](http://wordpress.org/plugins/jetpack/) is a plugin that ships with many modules. Why install the whole package, if you're just interested in one module?!

This plugin is the exact [Sharing module](http://jetpack.me/support/sharing/) of the original Jetpack plugin, only without all the extra stuff.

The version number of this plugin will follow the version number of Jetpack. This way, it's easier for you to know which Jetpack version this module was extracted from.

Things you'd be happy to know:

* The module is almost untouched. (Some lines had to be removed and some had to be added, for the sole reason of making the module a stand-alone plugin)
* The module was carefully extracted from the package. That means there is no missing feature or some irrelevant code.
* The module does not require a connection to a WordPress.com account.

Note: Translations was not included, due to the fact that Jetpack uses one transaltion file for all the modules, which makes it really difficult to extract translations.
The good news is that the module can be translated easily.
